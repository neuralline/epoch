yarn add epoch
```

## what is it

```sh
epoch is a collection of browser optimised precision timers for react, typescript and javascript functions. includes: wait, at, isTime and timer
```

## why

```sh
epoch uses requestAnimationFrame rather than set time out so it could be more precise and optimised by the browser
```

## Usage example

import {wait} from 'epoch'

const scheduledTask = async () => {
  //before
  await wait(5000)
  //after
  console.log('after five second')
}
